# Description (required)
Description=The package provides 3 classifiers. The rule classifier RoughSet uses the concepts of discernibility matrix, reducts and rules generated from reducts. \
It provides variety of algorithms generating reducts including giving more general rules local reducts and has modes to work with incomplete data and inconsistent data. \
The k nearest neighbors classifier RseslibKnn provides variety of distance measures that can work also for data with both numeric and nominal attributes and has built-in k optimization. \
It implements a fast neighbors searching algorithm making the classifier work for very large data sets. The classifier has also the mode to work as RIONA algorithm. \
The third classifier LocalKnn is the extension of the k nearest neighbors method that induces a local metric for each classified object. \
It is dedicated rather to large data sets (2000+ training instances) and improves accuracy particularly in case of data containing nominal attributes.
