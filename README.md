# Rseslib
Rough set and machine learning data structures, algorithms and tools in Java. The project includes algorithms for discernibility matrix, reducts, decision rules and other rough set concepts and wide range of discretization and classification algorithms, including optimized for large data high-accuracy K-NN classifier implementing analogy-based reasoning. The project includes also QMAK - a tool for interacting with machine learning models and visualizing classification process and Simple Grid Manager for running experiments on many computers or cores.

The project is built with Maven.
