QProjectView_popup_menu = Project desktop. You can add here tables, classifiers and other objects. They are represented by icons. Use right click to add them to the area. Use right click on an icon to see the list of possible actions on the object. Actions of some objects may need selection of another object. Use left click on an icon to select an object (there is always only one object selected for each object type). 
QProjectView_TableIcon = Table with data. Use right click on the area of main window to create new table ('New Table' option) or to load a table from file ('Open Table' option). You can load tables in ARFF, CSV and RSES2 formats. Double click the table icon to display its data. Use right click menu on the table icon to train and test classifiers, generate charts and other operations.  
QProjectView_ClassifierIcon = Trained classifier. To train a selected type of classifier use 'Train classifier' option from the right click menu of table icon. Double click on a classifier icon displays the classifier if it implements visualization. Some classifiers like C45Vis or VisualNeuronNetwork enable modifications of their models in the visualization panel. Use right click menu on the classifier icon to classify a selected table, test the classifier and for other operations.
QProjectView_MultiClassifierIcon = Experiment comparing many classifiers on selected data. Use 'New Experiment' option from the right click menu on the main window area to create a new experiment. Use 'Add' option from the right click menu of the experiment icon to add classifiers to be tested. Double click the experiment icon to change the configuration of the added classifiers. You can add many classifiers of the same type with different configurations to the experiment. Use right click menu of the experiment icon to train the added classifiers on selected table and test on another table or run one of available multiple tests.  
QProjectView_MultipleTestResultIcon = Result of a multiple test. Multiple test results are obtained by running an experiment with one of available multiple tests like cross-validation. Double click the multiple test result icon to display the results.
QProjectView_TestResultIcon = Result of a single test. Single test results can be obtained either from test of a single trained classifier or by running single test experiment. Double click the test result icon to display the results. 
QProjectView_visualize_classification = Visualization of classifiers includes visualization of classification of a single row. To display the classification process first select a classifier that implements visualization then open a table, select the row that you want to visualize classification for, use right click on the row and select 'Classify row'.
