QProjectView_popup_menu = Project desktop. You can add here tables, classifiers, experiments and experiment results. They are represented by icons. Use right click to add them to the area. Use double left click on an icon to view the object. Use right click on an icon to see the list of possible actions on the object. Action on an object may require selecting and making active another object first. Use single left click on an inactive icon to change the object to active. There is always at most one object active for each object type. 
QProjectView_TableIcon = Table with data. Use right click on the area of main window to create new table ('New Table' option) or to load a table from file ('Open Table' option). You can load tables in ARFF, CSV and RSES2 formats. Double click the table icon to display its data. Use right click menu on the table icon to train and test classifiers, generate charts and other operations. To get the classifier list in the pop-up menu in an open table view updated after new classifiers are trained close the table view with 'Ok' or 'Cancel' button and reopen it with double click on the table icon.
QProjectView_ClassifierIcon = Trained classifier. To train a selected type of classifier use 'Train classifier' option from the right click menu of table icon. Double click on a classifier icon displays the classifier if it supports visualization. Some classifiers like C45DecisionTreeVisual or NeuralNetworkVisual enable modifications of their models in the visualization panel. Use right click menu on the classifier icon to classify the active table, test the classifier and for other operations. Check out the chapter "Classifier types" in Rseslib User Guide for information on specific classifier types: https://rseslib.mimuw.edu.pl/rseslib.pdf.
QProjectView_visualize_classification = Visualization of classifiers includes visualization of classification of a single row. To display the classification process of a trained classifier supporting visualization open a table, left click on the row that you want to visualize classification for, then use right click, select the option 'Classify row with' and select the classifier. The option 'Classify row' visualizes classification of the active classifier. Check out the chapter "Classifier types" in Rseslib User Guide for information on visualization of specific classifier types: https://rseslib.mimuw.edu.pl/rseslib.pdf.
QProjectView_MultiClassifierIcon = Experiment compares many classifiers on selected data. Use 'New Experiment' option from the right click menu on the main window area to create a new experiment. Use 'Add' option from the right click menu of the experiment icon to add classifiers to be tested. Double click the experiment icon to change the configuration of the added classifiers. You can add many classifiers of the same type with different configurations to the experiment. Use right click menu of the experiment icon to train the added classifiers on the active table and test on another table or run one of available multiple tests.  
QProjectView_MultipleTestResultIcon = Multiple test results are obtained by running an experiment with one of available multiple tests like cross-validation. Double click the multiple test result icon to display the results.
QProjectView_TestResultIcon = Single test results can be obtained either from test of a single trained classifier or by running single test experiment. Double click the test result icon to display the results.
